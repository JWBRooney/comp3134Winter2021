The only named employee I can find is Ryan Holman who is listed as an IT Manager

I'm starting to think this company may not exist anymore, if it ever did.
Their web presence is nearly nonexistent except for Ryan Holman, his
Twitter page for the company, which hasn't been active in a year, 
and a pinterest page which also looks pretty inactive.

No answer at their listed phone number either, which seems weird for 2:45 on a Monday. 

Kind of wishing I had looked for more than the word Wizard in the 
title before picking a company.
